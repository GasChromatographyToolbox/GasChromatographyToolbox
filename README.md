# GasChromatographyToolbox

This is the central repository for the tools I developed for the simulation of gas chromatographic (GC) separation in the Julia Programming Language. Different notebooks, using [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), for this simulation will be collected here.  

The toolbox consists of the following parts:

[GasChromatographySimulator.jl](https://github.com/JanLeppert/GasChromatographySimulator.jl)

This is the base for the GC simulation. The migration and development of the peak width of several substances through a capillary column with a stationary phase is modeled by two ordinary differential equations (ODE). The model is described in detail in [Leppert](http://10.1016/j.chroma.2020.460985) and the package is presented in [Leppert2022](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04565).

[GasChromatographySystems.jl](https://github.com/JanLeppert/GasChromatographySystems.jl)

This package uses the GasChromatographySimulator.jl package to simulate the separation in complex GC systems, which consists of multiple capillary columns, e.g. multidimensional GC, GCÃ—GC or multiple outlets at different pressures. It also works as a flow calculator for complex GC systems.

[RetentionParameterEstimator.jl](https://github.com/JanLeppert/RetentionParameterEstimator.jl)

This package uses the GasChromatographySimulator.jl package to estimate retention parameters from multiple GC measurement (temperature programmed and/or isothermal). The difference between measured and simulated retention times is minimized using a Newton method with trust regions, to determine the best fitting set of retention parameters. More information can be found in [Leppert2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2023.464008).

![RetentionData](/assets/RetentionData_logo.png)

[RetentionData](https://github.com/JanLeppert/RetentionData)

This is not a Julia package, only a collection of retention data found in literature and from our measurements. Mor information can be found in [Brehmer2023](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c01348).

## Notebooks

[Pluto notebooks](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) are used as a simple user interface to use the GC simulation without the need to code yourself. To use these notebooks it is necessary to install the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/)

### Install Julia and Pluto

First [Julia, v1.6 or above,](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release) must be installed for your operating system.

In a second step you have to start Julia and you have to add the **Pluto** package:

```julia
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add(Pluto)
```

To run Pluto, use the following commands:

```julia
julia> using Pluto; Pluto.run();
```

Pluto will open your browser. In the field `Open from file` the URL of a notebook or the path to a locally downloaded notebook can be insert and the notebook will open and load the necessary packages.

An expanded tutorial can be found in this [PDF](https://github.com/JanLeppert/GasChromatographySimulator.jl/raw/main/InstallGuide.pdf).

### Overview of notebooks

* `simulation_conventional_GC.jl` ... Simulation of GC separation in one capillary column using [GasChromatographySimulator.jl](https://github.com/JanLeppert/GasChromatographySimulator.jl). Retention data from [RetentionData](https://github.com/JanLeppert/RetentionData) is used.
* `simulation_thermal_gradient_GC.jl` ... Simulation of GC separation in one capillary column with a thermal gradient along the column using [GasChromatographySimulator.jl](https://github.com/JanLeppert/GasChromatographySimulator.jl). Retention data from [RetentionData](https://github.com/JanLeppert/RetentionData) is used.
