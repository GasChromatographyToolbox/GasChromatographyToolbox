This is the central repository for the tools I developed for the simulation of gas chromatographic (GC) separation in the Julia Programming Language. Different notebooks, using [Pluto.jl](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl), for this simulation will be collected here.  

The toolbox consists of the following parts:

[GasChromatographySimulator.jl](https://github.com/GasChromatographyToolbox/GasChromatographySimulator.jl)

This is the base for the GC simulation. The migration and development of the peak width of several substances through a capillary column with a stationary phase is modeled by two ordinary differential equations (ODE). The model is described in detail in [[Leppert2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2020.460985)] and the package is presented in [[Leppert2022](https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04565)].

[GasChromatographySystems.jl](https://github.com/GasChromatographyToolbox/GasChromatographySystems.jl)

This package uses the GasChromatographySimulator.jl package to simulate the separation in complex GC systems, which consists of multiple capillary columns, e.g. multidimensional GC, GCÃ—GC or multiple outlets at different pressures. It also works as a flow calculator for complex GC systems.

![RetentionParameterEstimator.jl](/assets/RetentionParameterEstimator_logo_w_s.png)

[RetentionParameterEstimator.jl](https://github.com/GasChromatographyToolbox/RetentionParameterEstimator.jl)

This package uses the GasChromatographySimulator.jl package to estimate retention parameters from multiple GC measurement (temperature programmed and/or isothermal). The difference between measured and simulated retention times is minimized using a Newton method with trust regions, to determine the best fitting set of retention parameters. More information can be found in [[Leppert2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chroma.2023.464008)].

![RetentionData](/assets/RetentionData_logo_w_s.png)

[RetentionData](https://github.com/GasChromatographyToolbox/RetentionData)

This is not a Julia package, only a collection of retention data found in literature and from our measurements. Mor information can be found in [[Brehmer2023](https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.3c01348)].

## Notebooks

[Pluto notebooks](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) are used as a simple user interface to use the GC simulation without the need to code yourself. To use these notebooks it is necessary to install the [Julia Programming Language](https://julialang.org/)

### Install Julia and Pluto

First, the latest stable version of  [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/#current_stable_release) must be installed for your operating system.

In a second step you have to start Julia and you have to add the **Pluto.jl** package. Start Julia by double-clicking the Julia executable or running `julia` from the command line to start an interactive session. Using the package manager Pkg you can add the Pluto.jl package as followed:

```julia
julia> import Pkg; Pkg.add(Pluto)
```

To run Pluto, use the following commands:

```julia
julia> using Pluto; Pluto.run();
```

Pluto will open your browser. In the field `Open from file` the URL of a notebook or the path to a locally downloaded notebook can be insert and the notebook will open in safe preview mode. To run the code of the notebook you have to click `Run notebook code` in the upper right corner. This finally starts the interactive notebook and load the necessary packages.

> :warning: **Running a notebook for the first time after installing Julia can take some time to download the needed packages to your system.** 

An expanded tutorial can be found in this [PDF](https://github.com/GasChromatographyToolbox/GasChromatographySimulator.jl/raw/main/InstallGuide.pdf). The notebook is than executed, by first loading the needed packages. In a first run, after installing Julia for the first time, this can take an extended amount of time because the packages and their dependencies have to be downloaded first. A later start of the notebook should be faster, but loading all the packages can take several 10s of seconds or even some minutes.
